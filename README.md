Website:

My Family's website I'm creating as a personal project for the summer (I will work on this in my free time later in spring 2021, right now it is unfinished). 
Adobe XD File: The design of the website. I didn't start with mobile since I'm not sure when I'll work on this again after I finish the website.
  
src: All of the code is in this file. 
Assets: Holds scss and css files. 
Components: Holds jsx files. 
Images: Holds all of the images I'm using for the website.
